## The Internet
* A global network of computers.

* Computers talk to each other using the **TCP/IP** protocol.
* **HTTP** handles web traffic (request/responses).

## Web Servers
 - **Websites/Webpages** are files stored on computers that run a piece of software called **web server** (Apache, Nginx, etc).
 - **Hosting companies** provide space on a server for your website.
 - **Domain names** can be purchased from registars and linked to your hosting account/web server.
 - **DNS** is used to map IP addresses to domain names.
